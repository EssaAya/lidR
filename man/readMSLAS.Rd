\description{
Multispectral laser data are often stored in 3 differents files. If it is the case this function
reads the .las or .laz files of each channel and merge them into an object of class
\link[lidR:LAS-class]{LAS} and takes care of attributing an ID to each channel. If the
multisprectral point-cloud is already stored in a single file, use \link{readLAS}. This function
is somehow experimental and its names could change.
